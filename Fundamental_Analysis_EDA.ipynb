    "There are various factors responsible for stock market speculation and inefficiency. Investor emotions as well as illogical or unscientific methods used to choose entry and exit price or wether to buy one stock or other are common investor mistakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting stock price movements with precision has obvious benefits but has proven to be a very difficult endeavor since there are many aspects and reasons why a stock's price goes one way or the other. There are many theories of why prices move and how we can predict the direction and target price of any stock. \n",
    "\n",
    "In its core a price is set when a seller agrees to part with his stock at a certain price and a buyer is willing to purchase that stock at that specific price. When we have the meeting of two minds, a transaction happens. The final daily price of each stock which is the time frame I used to calculate average quarterly prices, is in the end decided by the cumulation of meeting of the minds of all of the market participants. \n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is that if the majority of money in the market uses a certain trading strategy, then that strategy will by inference decide how the stock price is decided at the end of each day. Because statistically speaking, people trading at major trading desks in major monetary instutions(wether it be big banks or hedge funds etc. from now on referred to as institutional money) do not change very often and they are coveted by their institutions with very high salaries, the assumption is the trading strategies of such people, which is a major driver of companies stock prices, in each industry, does not change much over time. This in turn effect almost all other companies in that sector. \n",

    "According to investopedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Institutional investors control a significant amount of all financial assets in the United States and exert considerable influence in all markets. This influence has grown over time and can be confirmed by examining the concentration of ownership by institutional investors in the equity of publicly traded corporations. Institutional investors own about 80% of equity market capitalization. As the size and importance of institutions continue to grow, so do their relative holdings and influence on the financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The North American asset management industry controlled more than $88.5 trillion at the end of 2017, according to McKinsey estimates.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a certain stability in the underlying fundamental analysis done on each specific stock by people at these trading desks and our assumption is that trading trends on those stocks stay similar throughut long time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years algorithmic trading software has been gaining a large share of the entire stock market trading volume. The use of algorithms in trading increased after computerized trading systems were introduced in American financial markets during the 1970s. In 1976, the New York Stock Exchange introduced the Designated Order Turnaround (DOT) system for routing orders from traders to specialists on the exchange floor. In the following decades, exchanges enhanced their abilities to accept electronic trading, and by 2009, upwards of 60 percent of all trades in the U.S. were executed by computers.[\"Deutche Bank Research. \"High-Frequency Trading: Reaching the Limits,\" Page 2.

    "With the easy access to share information and data, many investors worldwide are interested in predicting stock prices. My project is based on a personal approach to stock selection, with the use of fundamental information and respective return ratio using methods and parameters commonly used by professional financial analysts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal has been for the algorithm to identify and map correlations between different fundamental indictors like Price to Earnings/Sales ratio, Dividend Yield, Earnings Per Share percentage change etc. and the price range in consequtive quarters. The algorithm is meant to validate and aid us in our stock selection methodology by providing us a prediction of wether the stock will be going up or down based on all the previous financial fundamental indicators.\n",

    "The factors used in our model are chosen by industry experts in their models from hundreds of indicators and to the best of the author's knowledge are most relevant in deciding the fundamental value of a company. If we are able to accurately evaluate the value of a company(presnt and future) and compare it to the expert's predictions (comparing to yahoo finance and google finance), while also using a sliding window to make past predictions into their future and analyzing margin of error, we can optimize our method to closely value a company and thus decide wether it is undervalued, overvalued, or fairly valued.\n",
    "under valued is defined as being 3% or more lower than the price that we predict it should have and over valued is defined as having a price 3% and over the predicted price. Three percent is a commonly used tolerance margin for considering a price breakthrough by experts in th field, but can be set to any value the investor is comfortable with(the higher the margin the lower the risk of mistakes with the caveat that you might lose many trades if it is too high)\n"
