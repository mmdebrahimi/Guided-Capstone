# Guided-Capstone
Capstone project for SpringBoard DataScience career track

As we know the stock market attracts alot of people and intrigues the greatest minds to make it big. 
In this project I have tried to replicate how professional financial analysts approach valuation of companies through fundamental analysis. Fundamental analysis (FA) is a method of measuring a security's intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors. Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect the security's value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the company's management.

The purpose is to arrive at a number that an investor can compare with a security's current price in order to see whether the security is ***undervalued*** or ***overvalued***, according to investopedia.

This projects goal is to beat the average market passive income of 7% and later go beyond that while minimizing the risk.
The Fundamental Analysis software estimates a value range based on the company's financial indicators used by the industry in order to predict the future Quarter(s)/Year(s). The analysis is done on S&P 500 companies.

There is also an NLP algorithm which sifts through Management discussions to add weights to our results. Basically this Model tells me what to buy on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being a strong buy and 0 being a strong sell.

* I also plan to mix this with my Technical analysis software signals which tells me when to buy the strong sell from this model.
